# DTtoEpoch

Python Date-Time to Epoch converter

Convert a date-time to
Epoch milliseconds.

This is useful when searching
through database fields that
use the Epoch timestamp and your
database browser does not convert
the timestamp.

Provide your date and time in UTC
using this format: 2014-01-26 23:44:15

Use the website:
https://currentmillis.com/
to confirm results.

This UTC date-time:
2014-01-26 23:44:15
converts to 1390779855000.0
but 1390779855380 is the same
date-time.
